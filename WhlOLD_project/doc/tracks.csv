Tracks, Excerpt
Get Lucky, We are up all night to GET
Where is my Mind, Try this trip and spin it-yeah
You Can't always get what you want, I saw her today at the reception
Acrobat, And every Book has been Read
Until The End of The World, In my dream I was drownong my sorrows
Under Pressure, Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn
Heart Shaped Box, Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Cara è la fine, Zig Zag nel Caos
